# aws-buddy

`aws-buddy` is my personal aws cli tool. Its main goal is to make common tasks I do easy and fast.

I mostly use this tool to avoid having to load the aws web interface or use the clunky aws cli tool.

Perhaps the most useful/weird command is `aws-buddy org each <sub-command>` which will run a command for each child account in an organization (or each account in a file).
